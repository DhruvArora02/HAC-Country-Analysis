HAC-Country-Analysis
====================

Project Overview
----------------

This project implements **Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)** to analyze and categorize countries based on various socio-economic indicators. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights into global socio-economic trends, making it easier to understand the relationships between different countries in terms of their key features.

Key Features
------------

*   **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the socio-economic data of countries for clustering, including handling missing values and normalization.

*   **Hierarchical Clustering**: Apply HAC to group countries based on their similarities in features such as GDP, life expectancy, and population.

*   **Dendrogram Visualization**: Generate dendrograms to visually represent the hierarchical structure of the clusters and observe how countries are grouped at different levels of similarity.

*   **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster and interpret socio-economic patterns within the groups.

*   **Country Grouping**: Categorize countries into clusters, helping to identify regions with similar economic and demographic features.

Technologies Used
-----------------

*   **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation, clustering, and analysis.
    
*   **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and handling the socio-economic dataset.
    
*   **SciPy**: Provides the `linkage` and `dendrogram` functions for performing HAC and visualizing the results.
    
*   **Matplotlib**: Used for generating visualizations, including dendrograms and cluster plots.

How It Works
------------

1.  **Data Preprocessing**: The socio-economic dataset is loaded, cleaned, and standardized for clustering. Missing values are handled, and numerical features are scaled to ensure accurate clustering.

2.  **Hierarchical Clustering**: HAC is applied using the `linkage` method to compute the proximity matrix and cluster the countries based on their socio-economic indicators.

3.  **Dendrogram Generation**: The hierarchical structure of the clusters is visualized using a dendrogram, which shows how countries are grouped at each level of the tree.

4.  **Cluster Analysis**: After clustering, the countries are grouped into clusters. The characteristics of each cluster are analyzed to understand the socio-economic similarities between the countries within each group.

5.  **Country Grouping**: Countries are classified into distinct clusters, helping to highlight countries with similar economic profiles.
